"I know you' helps doctors to get a quick glance of patient history by using machine learning to highlight keywords like patient's past symptoms, medicine and doctor's actions taken.

By searching by patient's name, the doctor can visualize all the patient basic information, a quick medical history briefing with highlighted keywords and access to the complete medical history files.
